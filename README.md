Athletica Twin: Digital Twin for Injury Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project is a part of my Professional Diploma in Data Science & Business Analytics. It introduces a Digital Twin framework combined with Explainable AI (XAI) to monitor athletes in real-time and predict potential injuries using IoT-based physiological data.

The project follows a rigorous 3-step analytical approach:

Phase 1 (Excel): Data cleaning and descriptive statistics.

Phase 2 (R Programming): Biostatistical correlation and hypothesis testing.

Phase 3 (Python): AI modeling (LSTM) and Digital Twin simulation with XAI transparency.


🚀 Key Features
Predictive Analytics: Achieve up to 92% accuracy in injury risk prediction.

Explainable AI: Integration of SHAP values to explain the "why" behind every prediction.

Interactive Dashboard: Real-time visualization of Fatigue Index vs. Injury Risk using Chart.js.

Responsive Web Design: Fully mobile-friendly interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5.
